# Vermont Code Camp 2018<br/>Sponsor Information  
The 10th annual Vermont Code Camp will be held on September 15, 2018 in Burlington, Vermont.  

This full day event will bring together technology community members, students and professionals from around Vermont and beyond. A wide variety of software technologies will be represented, and session topics will likely include programming, databases, web and more.


Vermont Code Camp is free event for attendees and organized entirely by community volunteers, with the help of our sponsors.
Our 2017 event drew 250 attendees. We had 7 session slots throughout the day with 5 sessions running at any one time. You can see last year’s schedule at https://www.vtcodecamp.org/2017/schedule.  

WCAX visited during the day which was exciting. Co-organizer, Rob Hale, was interviewed about the event. You can see that clip here: http://www.wcax.com/content/news/A-tech-lovers-paradise-445146003.html
